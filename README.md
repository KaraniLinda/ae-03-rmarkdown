# Markdown syntax

Markdown is a way to format text that looks great on any device. It doesn't do anything fancy like change font size,colour or type - it just does the essentials using keyboard symbols that you already know

# Outputs

I can create several outputs from a markdown file. That includes HTML, PDF or even MS word

# File format

Markdown is a markdown language and non proprietary open file format that contains plain text and is machine readable
